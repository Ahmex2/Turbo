# Android System Optimization Script

This Python script is designed to optimize the performance of Android devices by applying various system optimizations. It targets areas such as CPU performance, additional system settings, camera processing capabilities, game mode activation, RAM cleaning, network settings, and temperature management.

## Features
- **CPU Performance Optimization:** Sets the CPU governor to 'interactive' permanently for improved system responsiveness.
- **Additional System Optimizations:** Applies additional settings permanently to optimize system performance, including window animation scale, processor utilization, UI rendering, and more.
- **Camera Processing Enhancement:** Enhances camera processing capabilities to mimic those of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.
- **Game Mode Activation:** Activates game mode permanently to eliminate dropped frames during gaming sessions.
- **Automatic RAM Cleaning:** Enables automatic RAM cleaning to prevent lag by dropping caches.
- **Network Settings Optimization:** Optimizes network settings permanently for improved network performance.
- **Temperature Management:** Ensures low temperature permanently to prevent overheating issues.

## How to Use
1. Ensure that Termux is installed on your Android device.
2. Run the script using Termux to apply the optimizations.
   ```bash
   python Turbo.py
   ```
3. Check the log file (`android_optimization.log`) for details on the optimization process and any encountered errors.

## Notes
- This script may require root access to execute certain optimizations effectively.
- Use this script at your own risk. While it aims to enhance system performance, it may not be suitable for all devices and configurations.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Termux (with termux-exec package installed)
