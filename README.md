# Turbo

Turbo is a Python script that can be used to optimize the performance of your Android device. The script includes a number of optimizations that can improve your device's battery life, speed, and overall performance.

## Prerequisites

Before using Turbo, you will need to make sure that your computer and Android device meet the following requirements:

- Python 3: Turbo requires Python 3 to be installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB): Turbo uses ADB to communicate with your Android device over USB. You can install ADB as part of the [Android SDK Platform-Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).

In addition, you will need to enable USB debugging on your Android device. You can do this by going to **Settings > Developer options > USB debugging** and toggling the switch to the on position.

## Installation

To install Turbo, simply download the `turbo.py` script and save it to your computer.

## Usage

To use Turbo, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Android device to your computer via USB cable.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to the directory where the `turbo.py` script is saved.
3. Type `python3 turbo.py` or `python turbo.py` depending on your Python installation to run the script.
4. Follow the prompts in the script to select the optimizations you want to perform on your Android device.

Please note that some optimizations may require root access on your device, and that not all optimizations may be applicable to all devices. Therefore, it is important to read and understand the prompts in the script before making any changes to your device.

## Available Optimizations

Turbo includes the following optimizations:

### System Optimizations

- Install required dependencies: This option installs the required dependencies for running Turbo on your computer.
- Enable USB debugging: This option enables USB debugging on your Android device, which is required for communicating with ADB.
- Install the Turbo script: This option installs the Turbo script on your Android device, which allows you to perform optimizations directly from your device.

### Performance Optimizations

- Disable system animations: This option disables system animations, which can improve your device's speed and performance.
- Set charging speed to maximum: This option sets your device's charging speed to the maximum supported by your device, which can reduce charging time.
- Set CPU governor to performance: This option sets your device's CPU governor to performance mode, which can improve your device's speed and responsiveness.
- Optimize memory usage: This option optimizes your device's memory usage, which can improve performance and reduce lag.

### Customization Optimizations

- Customize device settings: This option allows you to customize various settings on your device, such as the display brightness, font size, and wallpaper.
- Optimize camera settings: This option optimizes your device's camera settings, which can improve the quality of your photos and videos.
