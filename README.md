# Android Device Optimization Script

This Python script automates the process of optimizing an Android device's performance and stability using ADB commands and the Turbo script repository.

## Overview

The script facilitates the optimization process by:

- **Installing Essential Packages:** Installs necessary packages (`python`, `git`, `tsu`, `adb`, `com.termux`) on the connected Android device.
- **Enabling USB Debugging:** Ensures smooth execution by enabling USB debugging to execute ADB commands seamlessly.
- **Utilizing Turbo Script:** Clones the Turbo script repository and executes it on the device to further enhance performance.
- **Optimizing Device Settings:** Sets device configurations for improved performance by modifying various settings related to animations, Wi-Fi, processor scaling, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
- Termux (or a similar terminal emulator for Android)

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
    - Connect your Android device to the computer via USB.
    - Ensure USB debugging is enabled on the device.

2. **Execution:**
    - Clone or download this repository onto your computer.
    - Navigate to the script directory in your terminal.

3. **Run the Script:**
    ```
    python android_optimization.py [-v | --verbose]
    ```

    **Optional Arguments:**
    - `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging for detailed output.

## Troubleshooting

- **Device Connection:** Ensure the device is correctly connected and USB debugging is enabled.
- **Error Logs:** Check the logs (`android_optimization.log`) for installation errors or missing dependencies.
- **Package Availability:** Verify the availability of necessary packages on the device for successful execution.

## Disclaimer

This script alters device settings and installs packages. Use it cautiously and review the code before execution.
