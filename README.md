## Getting Started

To use this script to optimize your Android device for gaming, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your device.

   ```shell
   # Example installation command for required dependencies
   sudo apt install python git tsu
   ```

2. **Enable USB Debugging:** Enable USB debugging on your Android device. This is necessary for certain optimizations.

3. **Install Turbo Script:** The script uses the Turbo script for some optimizations. Install it using the following commands:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/fkpwolf/turbo
   chmod +x ./turbo/turbo.sh
   tsudo ./turbo/turbo.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Optimization Script:** Execute the optimization script with the desired settings:

   ```shell
   python optimize_android.py -v
   ```

5. **Customize Settings (Optional):** Depending on your preferences, you can customize settings such as screen brightness and app background data restrictions within the script.

6. **Use with Caution:** Be mindful that certain optimizations, especially fast charging, may have an impact on your device's battery life.
